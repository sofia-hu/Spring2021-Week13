# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week13: An overview of ML and Deep Learning

After quickly reviewing few DL architectures, specifically UNet implementation, we will chat about a general overview of what we learned this year in the class. We will see a case study: "Azavea RasterVision", an open source framework for deep learning in Satellite Imaging. We will walk over a complete example that includes installation, an example script for training and testing, and application of semantic segmentation using a pre-trained model. As part of this practical session we will also learn about two other useful and emerging tools, "Docker" and "QGIS".
